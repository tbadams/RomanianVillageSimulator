# RomanianVillageSimulator
A roguelike-like-like simulation of a small Romanian village beset by monsters, e.g. the beginning of Dracula.  Undertaken as an exercise in learning C++ and as such likely to remain mostly non-functional in perpetuity.  In what is increasingly clearly a mistake, uses the C++ bindings included in ncurses for front end.
